# Introduction to Machine Learning on Weather Data

This repository contains a directory of projects that cover using logistic regression to analyze and predict various aspects of weather data. The projects include information on data loading and preprocessing, model training, model evaluation, and prediction. The directory "python-sklearn-logistic-regression-2" contains the projects.

## Overview
The goal of this repository is to provide an introduction to the application of machine learning on weather data. By using logistic regression, we can analyze and predict various aspects of weather such as temperature, precipitation, and storm occurrence. These projects can serve as a starting point for further research and analysis on weather data.
